# Dinner Picker

This repository contains `freezer-picker`, a React + TypeScript project that helps you choose dinner items from your freezer list.

See [`freezer-picker/README.md`](freezer-picker/README.md) for setup and usage instructions.

The repository also includes a GitHub Actions workflow that publishes the app to
GitHub Pages whenever changes land on the `main` branch.
